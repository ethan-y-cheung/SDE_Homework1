This program entry point will be the Main class.

The program reads the Prithee sonnet from a file, randomly selects a word, and asks
the user to guess the word after printing the Sonnet up to that word. The program continues
until the user gets 3 correct or 3 incorrect answers. This is done through the Sonnet class,
which uses a static class called QuizQuestion to represent the context and answer for each
iteration of the program.
